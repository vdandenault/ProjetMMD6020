# ProjetMMD6020
This is a repo for a project in the class MM6020 "Fondements de la médecine computationnelle" given at Université de Montréal during the A2021 semester. 

## Usage

To execute the project, you must use the Runner provided in 'runner.ipynb'. This will train the available models over a series of epochs in hopes of finding the best performance. 

## Contributing
Pull request on welcomed. Here is a shortlist of tasks that should be prioritized next: \
  1. Expend the runner to expend the hyperparameter search \
  2. Add metrics and visualisation functions to be logged into MLflow for better model tracking \
  3. Add explainability of the current models with SHAP and PATH_EXPLAIN \
  4. Add data augmentation technics to better add robustness to the data \
  5. Expand on model architectures \
